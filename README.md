This is some code I wrote to manage and maintain my homebrewing obsession.

Conveniently, it's all licenced under the [BEERWARE licence][1] so you can basically do as you please with it; but given the nature of what the software is used for - if you should meet me at a pub ([The Wheatsheaf Hotel][2] is a favourite haunt!), or a [Homebrewing event][3] (I'm a member of SABC - South Australian Brewing Club), and if you find any or all of this software useful, I'd love a beer in return for my efforts.

Don't get me wrong. I wouldn't have written a single line of code if I didn't enjoy it, so there is no obligation! 

I'll aim to keep some notes and updates available on my [personal brewing blog][4] too, but don't count on it. Young kids and lots of beer to brew and drink, plus other hobbies, keep me pretty busy!
